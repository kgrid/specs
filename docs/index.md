# KGrid specs and standards

## [KGrid Common Object Package spec](packaging.md) ([KCOP] draft)

Compliant Knowledge Grid components produce, consume and manage computable biomedical knowledge [CBK]. CBK that conforms to a specific conceptual model, the KGrid Common Object Model [KCOM], seeks to satisfy the following goals:
- When knowledge is externalized (as a resource) it is far more findable, accessible, and significantly easier to manage in scalable information systems
- When CBK is characterized by what it does (as a service), it is far more interoperable and reusable at the point of practice
- When CBK is *both* externalized as a resource *and* characterized as a service it can participate in all phases of the research,  translational, clinical, and operational lifecycle far more easily, at a reduced cost, with more rapid adoption, and with higher degree of trust. 

The KGrid Common Object Package [KCOP] provides a standard way to package a collection of artifacts representing an implementation of CBK as both a managed resource and a deployable service, including code, appropriate metadata, and standards-compliant supporting artifacts.

CBK packaged according to the KCOP, and designed to meet the standard described in the KGrid Common Activation spec [KCA] for CBK services, will interoperate with any compliant system.
