# Introduction

The Activator is a reference implementation of the **activation** spec. This specification focuses on client interactions and integration with with various client systems. See runtime adapter development guide for more on how an Activator manages and interacts with runtimes. 

## Responsibilities of the Activator (...)

- provide access (HTTP Restful API) to the services (exposed as endpoints) from knowledge objects deployed to the Activator
- Provide status for associated runtimes, KOs deployed, and the Activator itself
- Allow KOs to be loaded/activated from local and remote source (in suitable runtimes)
- Manage and interface with suitable runtimes â€” embedded, native, remote (proxy)
- Enforce some aspects of trust, provenance, and reproducibility via policy, validation, and tracing/logging.
